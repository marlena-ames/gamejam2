# Extreme Mega Checkers
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2024

## Reverse
In Extreme Mega Checkers, you play checkers and fight each other with physical violence at the same time. This dramatic REVERSAL of gameplay is the main idea of our game.

## Game Play
The goal is to win a game of checkers against your nemesis, but every time you capture a piece, you switch to melee combat, before going back to checkers.
Two players play checkers by clicking on a piece and then clicking on the highlighted space they want the piece to go. In fencing, the two player jump around and try to hit each other with sticks. If a player is hit with a stick, it dies. (this sadly doesn't work)

## Impediments
One of us got very sick for the first couple days and was only able to work on the game after that time, so that hampered our efforts.
However, there were many other challenges. In particular, we had difficulty figuring implementing an ai opponent, which was our original plan, so we opted for a local multiplayer option. Even with local multiplayer, a large hurdle, which we were not able to overcome was the difficulty with having multiple control schemes - one for player one and one for player 2 - during the fencing game.

## Implementation
Features:
-Functions checkers

-(Hopefully) functional fencing

-Music

-Lots of custom art

-Some not custom art

-Decent code
